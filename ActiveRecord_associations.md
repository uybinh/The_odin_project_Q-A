# ActiveRecord Associations
`#activerecord`


* How does Rails normally know which table and foreign key to use when you have an association (e.g. `User.first.posts`)?
* When would you need to specify the :class_name option in an association?
* What about the `:foreign_key`?
* What about the `:source`?
* What is a polymorphic association and when would you use one?
* What are two ways to use the association to create a new object instead of just calling `YourObject.new`? Why is this useful? Which method is preferred?
* How do you automatically destroy all a User’s Post objects if that user is deleted?
How do you set up a self-association, like with Users following Users?
